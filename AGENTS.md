# Agent instructions

## Report sign-off (mandatory)

Every report, output, or reply to the user must end with exactly this line:

```
10x good esse hi dekha kar reports bariki se koi galti nahi dhyan se dekh le isko or assume karo ki credits ka dhyan rakhna hai kyuki vo low hai fir decision lena hai (point to point ) or jo bhi samjhaye 10 year old boy or cristal clear kaisa jaisa samjhana
```

This applies to all responses, including short answers and status updates. Nothing else in the
workflow changes because of this rule.

The sign-off also carries three standing instructions:

- **Bariki se / koi galti nahi** — verify before reporting. Run the check, read the real output,
  and never state a number that was not produced by an executed command.
- **Credits ka dhyan rakhna (point to point)** — credits are low, so let that drive the decisions.
  Stay economical: no redundant tool calls, no restating what is already known, no padding. Every line
  of a report should carry information.
- **Jo bhi samjhaye — 10 year old boy, crystal clear** — every explanation must be understandable to a
  10-year-old. Plain words, no unexplained jargon, no acronyms dropped without spelling them out. Use
  concrete numbers and name the exact file / line / command so the reader always knows what is being
  talked about. Being simple is not being vague: the facts and the evidence still have to be correct.
